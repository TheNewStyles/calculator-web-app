# javascript_calculator
I built this as a freecodecamp project it still has a few bugs with chaining operations. The requirments are listed below. I convert the string into Reverse Polish Notaton (postfix) by using the Shunting-yard algorithm and then evaluate the string. 

Build a JavaScript Calculator

Objective: Build a javascript calculator

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck.

When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
